## 📖 Detailed overview

Use this component to notify your users about the use of cookies on the site.

## ⚙️ Usage

Just add the component to the page and see how it works on the published site.
Since this component covers a part of the page content, we added the `visible` property to the Props panel which you can use to make the banner always visible or hide it the in the builder.

**Note:** The component works only on the published site.
