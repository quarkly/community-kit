## 📖 Detailed overview

Breadcrumb navigation provides a list of links to all previous (parent) pages that the user has visited, and shows the page of the website that is open at the moment.

## ⚙️ Usage

1. Create the nesting of two or more pages.
2. Add a component to any nested page.
3. If necessary, change the root page in the Props panel to any of the parent pages. The list of links in the component will start from the selected page.

**Attention!**

-   `Home • index` is the root page by default.
-   This component should be on a nested page.
-   Navigation will only work on the published site.

## 🧩 Components and Props

| Prop names |   Type   | Default | Example |
| ---------- | :------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Root page  | `string` |   `–`   | `index` |
| Separator  | `string` |   `/`   |   `-`   |
